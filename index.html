        <h2>Microfluidics</h2>
        <p>
            My research in microfluidics focuses on understanding and controlling fluid behavior at the microscale. 
            I've developed novel computational models to study capillary dynamics, wicking phenomena, and passive 
            control mechanisms in micro-channels. This work has applications in lab-on-a-chip devices, drug delivery 
            systems, and advanced materials processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key achievements include developing a universal framework for capillary dynamics and investigating 
            passive control of capillary rise in micro-channels, which has important implications for designing 
            more efficient microfluidic devices.

            This research investigated the Fåhræus-Lindqvist effect as a mechanism for controlling particle migration 
            in deformable channels. The study explored how fluid pressure driving the flow manifests into wall deformation, 
            with flow behavior governed by the Giesekus constitutive relation. A key finding was that the superposition 
            of contributions to migration from elastic forces and non-uniform channel geometry leads to a variety of 
            particle distributions with precise control capabilities.

            My work in reacting flows combines computational fluid dynamics with combustion science to develop 
            more efficient and stable burner designs. I've investigated porous media burners with various 
            topological configurations and studied their dynamic stability under oscillating inlet conditions.

            Notable contributions include integrating bio-inspired morphologies into porous media burners and 
            developing computational insights on interphase heat exchange. I've also worked on low-temperature 
            photocatalytic dry reforming of methane over novel catalyst structures, contributing to cleaner

            Through molecular dynamics simulations, I investigate the fundamental behavior of materials at the 
            atomic and molecular scale. This work bridges the gap between quantum mechanics and continuum 
            mechanics, providing insights into material properties and fluid behavior that cannot be captured

            My research in this area has contributed to understanding complex fluid behaviors, particularly in

            My research on droplets and non-Newtonian fluids explores the fascinating physics of complex fluids

            behavior on partially wettable substrates, and contact line dynamics.

            Key findings include discovering universality in coalescence of polymeric fluids and demonstrating 
            how contact line pinning and depinning can modulate phenomena like the rod-climbing effect (Weissenberg effect).

        <p>
            During my internship at ANSYS, I developed an automated Python toolbox for ICEPAK focused on estimating 
            heat transfer properties in electronic cooling from circuit designs. This toolbox is currently under 
            testing for production deployment and has the potential to significantly streamline thermal analysis 
            workflows for electronics engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key technical achievement was creating algorithms to generate 3D conductivity vector fields from 2D 
            grayscale maps, enabling accurate modeling of material distributions for different hardware components 
            including resistors, capacitors, vias, dielectrics, and fans. Through optimized computational geometry 
            and matrix operations, I achieved a 3x speedup in preprocessing while maintaining 98% accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also architected a full-stack software module using PySide6, integrating numerical solvers with a GUI 
            for rapid analysis of complex ECAD geometries. This work combined my expertise in thermal modeling with 
            software engineering to deliver practical tools for industry applications.

            At NASA Ames Research Center, I worked on the PuMA (Porous Microstructure Analysis) multiphysics software, 
            focusing on computational efficiency and accuracy improvements. My primary contribution was engineering 
            Monte Carlo integration algorithms that achieved a remarkable 100x acceleration in volumetric property 
            evaluation through advanced sampling and variance reduction techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            I developed sophisticated filtering algorithms for sparse 3D spatial data, optimizing numerical accuracy 
            for average property calculations in porous materials. This work was critical for characterizing materials 
            used in aerospace applications where accurate property prediction is essential for performance and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I conducted research on periodicity in random 3D point maps and its impact on the calculation 
            of average values across different control volumes. This fundamental research contributed to improving the 
            reliability of property predictions in heterogeneous materials, which has broad applications in materials 
            science and engineering.

        <p>
            My extended research position at the Indian Institute of Science resulted in groundbreaking work on 
            non-Newtonian fluid dynamics. I published the first study on universality of droplet coalescence in 
            non-Newtonian fluids using both sessile and pendant droplet generation techniques. This work revealed 
            fundamental scaling laws that govern coalescence behavior across different polymeric systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the computational side, I derived and implemented novel numerical schemes for viscoelastic fluid 
            dynamics, particularly for discretizing stress tensor evolution equations. These methods improved the 
            stability and accuracy of simulations for complex fluid flows that exhibit both viscous and elastic 
            properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also developed high-performance computing codes for molecular dynamics simulations across distributed 
            computing clusters, optimizing particle interaction models at atomic scales to model evaporation of gases 
            at low temperatures. This multi-scale approach bridged continuum and molecular perspectives, providing 
            deeper insights into fluid behavior. The work resulted in three peer-reviewed publications in prestigious 
            journals including Physics of Fluids, Soft Matter, and Langmuir.

        <h2>Heat Inverse - Thermal Engineering Intern</h2>
        <h4>Ithaca, NY | July 2022 - December 2022</h4>

            At Heat Inverse, I worked on developing quantitative models for cooling performance using electromagnetic 
            theory. This innovative approach improved performance predictions for radiative cooling systems by 
            incorporating fundamental physics principles into the modeling framework.

            I leveraged Python's Lowtran and Macromax libraries to simulate and analyze electromagnetic radiation 
            through thin films. This work involved understanding the interaction between electromagnetic waves and 
            material properties to optimize thermal management solutions. The models I developed helped predict how 
            different thin-film configurations would perform under various operating conditions.

            This internship provided valuable experience in applying theoretical electromagnetic concepts to practical 
            thermal engineering problems, demonstrating how multi-physics approaches can lead to more accurate and 
            comprehensive solutions in thermal management applications.
